# Analysis of Pokemon Stats

If you've made your way to this page, you probably don't want to be here. This is just me nerding out about pokemon while testing various features and packages of R, including:
* R notebooks (side note: how do you get the preview button back after knitting it once?)
* Xaringan presentations
* All of the tidyverse stuff
* Machine learning.

The most recent analysis can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NatalieWeaver/pokemon/blob/main/pokemon.nb.html)
