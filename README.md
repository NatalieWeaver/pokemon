# Analysis of Pokemon Stats

If you've made your way to this page, you probably don't want to be here. This is just me nerding out about pokemon while testing various features and packages of R, including:
* R notebooks (how do you get the preview button back after knitting it once?)
* Xaringan presentations (cow plot grids not showing up for some reason?)
* All of the tidyverse stuff
* Machine learning.

The most recent analysis can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NatalieWeaver/pokemon/blob/main/pokemon.nb.html).

The most recent xaringan slides can be found [here](https://github.com/NatalieWeaver/pokemon/blob/main/pokemon_xaringan.pdf).

The data can be found in this repository [here](https://github.com/NatalieWeaver/pokemon/blob/main/pokemon.csv), and I got it from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon).
